**[Canopy](https://github.com/canopyengine/canopy) is a node-based, declarative 2D game engine built in 
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), on top of the [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/) framework and inspired by [Godot](https://godotengine.org).**
It's designed to be **Kotlin-native**, built with declarative APIs, node composition, and reactive patterns in mind to
create games in a clean, expressive, and maintainable way.

**Canopy** focuses on delivering a **simple yet powerful** experience, giving developers the flexibility to build complex 
systems without sacrificing clarity or control.

## Design Goals

* Capable: Offer a complete set of 2D tools.
* Simple: Easy for beginners, flexible for experienced users.
* Modular: Use only what you need, replace what you don't.
* Fast: Your game should feel quick and snappy.
* Productive: Dev experience should be quick, and not bound by long compilation times.

## ⚠️ Work in progress ⚠️

**Canopy** is still a **work in progress**, and the **current version** is still unusable as is. Following the next weeks, 
the goal will be to release a **Headless Version** capable of running the core features in the **terminal**. 
See more details [here](https://github.com/canopyengine/canopy-docs/blob/main/docs/roadmap.md).

#### **Minimum Supported Kotlin Version**: **2.3.10**

> **Canopy** development aims to follow **Kotlin**'s improvements, so the minimum 
supported version will usually be the latest **stable** version.
